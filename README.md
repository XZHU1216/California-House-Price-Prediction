# California-House-Price-Prediction

The dataset is about housing prices in California. It is used to predict the median house value (median_house_value) in different districts based on various demographic and geographic characteristics.
Main task: Regression problem to predict the continuous variable median_house_value.

The dataset contains 20640 entries and 10 variables following.

    Longitude
    Latitude
    Housing Median Age
    Total Rooms
    Total Bedrooms
    Population
    Households
    Median Income
    Median House Value
    Ocean Proximity

To resolve the regression problem, the project is divided into four main parts : Data analysis, Data cleaning, Feature Engineering and Training of machine learning models. First part contains data analysis and cleaning as explained in EDA and data cleaning.ipynb. Second is training of machine learning models explained in Training Machine Learning Algorithms.ipynb.
